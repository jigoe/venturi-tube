# venturi-tube
This is a project I completed for my Rocket Engineering Practicum I course. This course was offered as a project based course in which students worked on Texas Rocket Engineering Lab projects. My project was to size, source, and analyze the cavitating venturis used to regulate liquid flow. The presentation and MATLAB files in this repository were a part of the analysis section of my  project.
